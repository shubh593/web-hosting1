            Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician.
            Often regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, though he had almost no formal
            training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number
            theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then
            considered unsolvable.Ramanujan’s knowledge of mathematics (most of which he had worked out for himself)
            was startling. Although he was almost completely unaware of modern developments in mathematics, 
            his mastery of continued fractions was unequaled by any living mathematician. He worked out the 
            Riemann series, the elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, the functional equations of the zeta
            function, and his own theory of divergent series, in which he found a value for the sum of such 
            series using a technique he invented that came to be called Ramanujan summation.

            Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans
            Eysenck, "he tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed
            for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally
            presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".When he was 15 years old, he obtained a
            copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics,
            2 vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of theorems, many presented with only the briefest
            of proofs and with no material newer than 1860, aroused his genius. Having verified the results
            in Carr’s book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas. In 1903 he
            secured a scholarship to the University of Madras but lost it the following year because he
            neglected all other studies in pursuit of mathematics.

        Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a mail correspondence
        with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognising
        Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes,
        Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that 
        "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",
        and some recently proven but highly advanced results.His papers were published in English
        and European journals, and in 1918 he was elected to the Royal Society of London. In 1917
        Ramanujan had contracted tuberculosis, but his condition improved sufficiently for him to
        return to India in 1919. He died the following year, generally unknown to the world at large
        but recognized by mathematicians as a phenomenal genius, without peer since Leonhard Euler 
        (1707–83) and Carl Jacobi (1804–51). Ramanujan left behind three notebooks and a sheaf of pages
        (also called the “lost notebook”) containing many unpublished results that mathematicians 
        continued to verify long after his death.
